## JAMES MAHONEY

- "I argue that path dependence characterizes speci¢cally those historical sequences in which contingent events set into motion institutional patterns or event chains that have deterministic properties."

- "First, some path-dependent investigators analyze self-reinforcing sequences characterized by the formation and long-term reproduction of a given institutional pattern. Self-reinforcing sequences often exhibit what economists call ``increasing returns.''"

- "With increasing returns, an institutional pattern ^ once adopted ^ delivers increasing bene¢ts with its continued adoption, and thus over time it becomes more and more di¤cult to transform the pattern or select previously available options, even if these alternative options would have been more ``e¤cient.'' 

- "A second basic type of path-dependent analysis involves the study of reactive sequences. Reactive sequences are chains of temporally ordered and causally connected events.9 These sequences are ``reactive'' in the sense that each event within the sequence is in part a reaction to temporally antecedent events. Thus, each step in the chain is ``de- pendent'' on prior steps.With reactive sequences, the ¢nal event in the sequence is typically the outcome under investigation, and the overall chain of events can be seen as a path leading up to this outcome."


### Parts

I suggest that all path-dependent analyses minimally have three defining features. 

First, path-dependent analysis involves the study of causal processes that are highly sensitive to events that take place in the early stages of an overall historical sequence.

Second, in a path-dependent sequence, early historical events are *contingent occurrences* that *cannot be explained on the basis of prior events* or ``initial conditions.'' [...] 

Examples: 

- For instance, in the Polya urn experiment, the final composition of the urn is entirely indeterminate before the first color has been selected; only once early random processes lead to the selection of certain colors does the system begin to stabilize around an equilibrium ... A system that exhibits path dependency is one in which outcomes are related **stochastically** to initial conditions.

- social analysts will consider an event to be *contingent* when its explanation appears to fall outside of existing scientific theory. For example, most sociologists will treat as contingent both *small events* that are *too specific* to be accommodated by prevailing social theories, such as the *assassination of a political leader* or the *specific choices and ``agency'' of particular individuals*, and large, seemingly random processes such as natural disasters or sudden market fluctuations.

- Ejemplo de Chile: Matanza de Santa Maria de Iquique (The Santa María School massacre was a massacre of striking workers, mostly saltpeter works miners, along with wives and children, committed by the Chilean Army in Iquique, Chile on December 21, 1907. The number of victims is undetermined but is reliably estimated at over 2,000.)

        -  cuestión social


Third, once contingent historical events take place, path-dependent sequences are marked by relatively deterministic causal patterns or what can be thought of as ``inertia'' ^ i.e., once processes are set into motion and begin tracking a particular outcome, these processes tend to stay in motion and continue to track this outcome. The nature of this inertia will vary depending on the type of sequence analyzed.With self-reinforcing sequences, inertia involves mechanisms that reproduce a particular institutional pattern over time.


### Self-reinforcing sequences

One type of path-dependent approach examines sequences that have self-reinforcing properties. In these sequences, initial steps in a particular direction induce further movement in the same direction such that over time it becomes difficult or impossible to reverse direction


**Thus, with a historicist explanation, the processes responsible for the genesis of an institution are different from the processes responsible for the reproduction of the institution**


Institutional genesis: **Critical junctures**, counterfactual analysis, and contingency

With self-reinforcing sequences, periods of institutional genesis correspond to critical junctures. *Critical junctures are characterized by the adoption of a particular institutional arrangement from among two or more alternatives*. These junctures are ``critical'' because *once a particular option is selected it becomes progressively more difficult to return to the initial point when multiple alternatives were still available*.


Critical junctures are often assessed through counterfactual analysis in which investigators imagine an alternative option had been selected and attempt to rerun history accordingly.

This kind of counterfactual analysis is especially persuasive when the investigator explores as a counterfactual antecedent an option that was predicted by theory to be selected, but that was not in fact selected. In doing so, the investigator avoids meaningless ``what if'' counterfactual analysis by considering a counterfactual antecedent that was actually available during a critical juncture period, and that, according to theory, should have been adopted.


# institutional reproduction

With path dependence, the causes of institutional reproduction are distinct from the processes that bring about the institution in the first place; path-dependent institutions persist in the absence of the forces responsible for their original production

The combination of contingency during critical junctures with subse- quent determinism via mechanisms of reproduction leads to a central paradox characterizing the outcomes of self-reinforcing, path-dependent sequences. Speci¢cally, these outcomes simultaneously: 1) contradict the predictions of a theoretical framework employed by the investigator; and 2) are reproduced by processes associated with the very theoretical framework they contradict. For example, in economic history, path- dependent analysts have gained notoriety by showing how certain economic outcomes are ``ine¤cient,'' thereby contradicting the predic- tions of neoclassical theory. Yet, these same analysts rely fully on mechanisms associated with neoclassical theory to explain the repro- duction of these ine¤cient outcomes once they are contingently selected.
