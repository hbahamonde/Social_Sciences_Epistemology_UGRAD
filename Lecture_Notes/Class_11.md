1. When case studies are constructed as narratives, then causal explanation can be achieved without either comparison or generalization. Narratives provide paths of causal links on a chronology of actions or events. The links, in turn, can be studied as Bayesian inferences generating Bayesian narratives. The causal paths in a narrative have a Boolean structure.

2. Bayesian: la probabilidad de un evento #2 depende de la probabilidad del evento anterior #1 (prior).

3. Boolean.

- "I shall interpret the social sciences, including sociology, as a quest for causal mechanisms.

- "A case study, be it of an individual, a dyad, a group, or even a historical period, often implies repeated observations, usually organized longitudinally, on a single unit of analysis.

- *Constant Conjunction*: WPDIA: "The philosopher David Hume used the phrase frequently in his discussion of the limits of empiricism to explain our ideas of causation and inference. In An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding and A Treatise of Human Nature Hume proposed that the origin of our knowledge of necessary connections arises out of observation of the constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances."

- *Nomic*: from Greek, it means "law."

- *Charles I*: WPDIA: "His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall. From 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. The monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660."

- *Counterfactual and Bayesian*: "Qué hubiera pasado si en vez, otro evento hubiera estado presente"? Manera de disprove que el evento 1 causa evento 2.
