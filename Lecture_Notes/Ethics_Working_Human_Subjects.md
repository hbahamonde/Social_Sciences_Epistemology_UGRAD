# The Ethics of Working with Human Subjects

- Contextualizar que lo que veremos de Entrevistas, pertenece a un congreso, y por eso el tono conversacional.
- 

1. Openness: I have interviewed dozens of pro-choice and pro-life activists, lobbyists, interest group leaders, litigants, and lawyers. I am genuinely fascinated with pro-life activism. However, I have found it more difficult to book interviews with pro-life people than with pro-choice people. This is probably due to my being an academic or my affiliation with a women’s studies program. *Pro-life activists might assume that I am very pro-choice and that my purpose in wanting to interview them or observe their meetings or demonstrations might be to belittle them*. That is not my intention, but pro-life people are nervous for many reasons about letting someone like me learn more about their organization, tactics, resources, and plans.

"you cannot mislead people."

2. Conflicts: "If I write about this (and the activists find out about it), it can hamper my access to these activists in the future for follow-up interviews". "I do not name people who hate each other, or who feel that someone is hogging the spotlight or using the group for his or her political career or personal agenda."

3. Context: "Since I am not a counselor or psychologist, I am not trained in how to help people who might be recalling something very traumatic in their lives."

"Some cried. Some revealed to me that they had been raped decades ago when nobody talked about it, no crisis hotlines or support groups existed, and they had simply kept the event to themselves. When the judge, however, said these things about another rape victim, they were in a place in their lives where they felt they had to do something about it. "

4. Additional tips


Ethically, it is important that we researchers send copies of what we write and publish to the people we have interviewed. It is more than a courtesy. It is an acknowledgment on the part of the researcher that without the interviewee, our work would be diminished. Many times people have called or writ- ten to thank me for sending them a copy of the chapter in which their interview is included in my works

5. Serendipity. 
   
Although it is probably a sin in political science to admit it, luck plays a big role in fieldwork and inter- views. If you are interviewing someone and they ask you if you would like to accompany them to their next meeting, or ride in the taxi with them while they go downtown and file legal papers at the courthouse, make sure that you do so.

## The Opposition to Covert Research

- flouting the principle of informed consent; 
- the erosion of personal liberty; 
- betraying trust; 
- pollution of the research environment; 
- producing a negative reputation of social research; 
- discrimination against the defenceless and powerless; 
- damage to the behaviour or interests of subjects; 
- covert methods may become habitual in the everyday life of the person doing the research; 
- the habit of deception may spread to other spheres of human interaction; 
- covert methods are invisibly reactive; 
- covert methods are seldom necessary; 
- covert methods have the effect of confining the scope of research; 
- and that the covert researcher suffers excessive strain in maintaining cover.


- there is recognition that informed consent is not always achievable in its absolute form

explicit debriefing of subjects, so that at least they know that research has been taking place even if they did not know it beforehand.

- Laud Humphreys’ Tearoom Trade (1970): The most famous case, which is regularly raised as a clear example of ‘bad ethics’ in the social sciences, is Laud Humphreys’ Tearoom Trade (1970).
