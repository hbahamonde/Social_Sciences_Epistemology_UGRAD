# The Ethics of Working with Human Subjects

- Contextualizar que lo que veremos de Entrevistas, pertenece a un congreso, y por eso el tono conversacional.
- 

1. Openness: I have interviewed dozens of pro-choice and pro-life activists, lobbyists, interest group leaders, litigants, and lawyers. I am genuinely fascinated with pro-life activism. However, I have found it more difficult to book interviews with pro-life people than with pro-choice people. This is probably due to my being an academic or my affiliation with a women’s studies program. *Pro-life activists might assume that I am very pro-choice and that my purpose in wanting to interview them or observe their meetings or demonstrations might be to belittle them*. That is not my intention, but pro-life people are nervous for many reasons about letting someone like me learn more about their organization, tactics, resources, and plans.

"you cannot mislead people."

2. Conflicts: "If I write about this (and the activists find out about it), it can hamper my access to these activists in the future for follow-up interviews". "I do not name people who hate each other, or who feel that someone is hogging the spotlight or using the group for his or her political career or personal agenda."

3. Context: "Since I am not a counselor or psychologist, I am not trained in how to help people who might be recalling something very traumatic in their lives."

"Some cried. Some revealed to me that they had been raped decades ago when nobody talked about it, no crisis hotlines or support groups existed, and they had simply kept the event to themselves. When the judge, however, said these things about another rape victim, they were in a place in their lives where they felt they had to do something about it. "

4. Additional tips


Ethically, it is important that we researchers send copies of what we write and publish to the people we have interviewed. It is more than a courtesy. It is an acknowledgment on the part of the researcher that without the interviewee, our work would be diminished. Many times people have called or writ- ten to thank me for sending them a copy of the chapter in which their interview is included in my works

5. Serendipity. 
   
Although it is probably a sin in political science to admit it, luck plays a big role in fieldwork and inter- views. If you are interviewing someone and they ask you if you would like to accompany them to their next meeting, or ride in the taxi with them while they go downtown and file legal papers at the courthouse, make sure that you do so.

This article discusses a covert participant observational study of door super- visors, or ‘bouncers’ as they are more traditionally called, in the night-time economy (NTE) of Manchester, England. [guardaespaldas de club]


## The Opposition to Covert Research

- flouting the principle of informed consent; 
- the erosion of personal liberty; 
- betraying trust; 
- pollution of the research environment; 
- producing a negative reputation of social research; 
- discrimination against the defenceless and powerless; 
- damage to the behaviour or interests of subjects; 
- covert methods may become habitual in the everyday life of the person doing the research; 
- the habit of deception may spread to other spheres of human interaction; 
- covert methods are invisibly reactive; 
- covert methods are seldom necessary; 
- covert methods have the effect of confining the scope of research; 
- and that the covert researcher suffers excessive strain in maintaining cover.


- there is recognition that informed consent is not always achievable in its absolute form

explicit debriefing of subjects, so that at least they know that research has been taking place even if they did not know it beforehand.

- Laud Humphreys’ Tearoom Trade (1970): The most famous case, which is regularly raised as a clear example of ‘bad ethics’ in the social sciences, is Laud Humphreys’ Tearoom Trade (1970).


One of the issues here is what I refer to as the ‘consent to what’ problem, in that social research is often contingent and all probabilities cannot be covered by the consent form. **mencionar el ejemplo de Redlawsk, y de que tuvo que "inventar" un problema (pantalla)**.


- Concerns have also been raised about the ethicality of ethics committees.

- Part of the problem is the continued adoption of inappropriate medical models of doing social research
- Punch (1986) comments that, in large organizations, it is difficult to get the full and informed consent of everybody involved. **participación observante compromete full disclosure, porque no todos van a saber**.
- What the researcher is trying to capture by investigative methods is often the unofficial view of an organization – what Shulman (1994) describes as ‘dirty data’.
- "the gifted researcher must break the boundaries between outsider and insider. We are supposed to ‘build rapport’ and develop such a level of trust and acceptance in our host societies that we do not distort social interaction. Anything less leads to the collection of skewed or superficial data. How can we reconcile effective participant/observation with truly informed consent?"

# Covert Doorman/Bouncer

- "My interests in studying this area grew out of being a regular consumer of pubs and clubs for many years, where bouncers were classic figures of both fear and fascination. I had trained in martial arts for several years prior to under- taking the study, which gave me the hardness passport (Patrick, 1973) for entry. This was a type of embodied ethnography, displaying the relevant body and cultural capital (Monaghan, 2002; Wacquant, 1995; Winlow, 2001) and interaction rituals (Goffman, 1967) to pass (Garfinkel, 1967) as a doorman. It was the art and politics of ‘faking friendship’ (Duncombe and Jessop, 2002) as I constructed a door career. After I had completed a local city council door staff training course I had made contact with a door agency that supplied door staff to pubs and clubs in Manchester city centre."
- "My ‘bouncer’s story’ of who I was still had to be sustained well after the study had finished and I was often, unexpectedly, called upon to ‘get back into character’, if you will, as I bumped into for- mer bouncers. The usual reply would be that I was in ‘early retirement’ or ‘I couldn’t stand the pace any more’."
- The experience and management of the post-fieldwork self is not new but can be a typical feature of covert work, which is marginalized in most methodological accounts, mainly because it is not a con- ventional sort of problem.
-  As I developed rapport and closer bonds in doing door work, the covert role became more of an emotional risk in that I felt a sort of ‘guilt clause’ in the sustained deception that I was involved in.
-  I covered 10 door sites, including pubs, clubs and café bars, which exhibit both their door order and status hierarchy. In this sense, I constructed a ‘door career’ as part of my fieldwork credibility strategy as I was often asked where I had worked and with whom.
-  I am not seeking to abolish professional codes nor add extensive regulations to them. Clearly, they are case contingent. The move I wish to make is to view ethics as contingent, dynamic, temporal, occasioned and situated affairs. 
-  The management of situated ethics is not only about adopting a theoretically reflexive attitude but also about a whole series of practical manoeuvres and tactics.
-  When a senior doorman of a famous Man- chester nightclub, which has since closed down, told me ‘I was in the firm’ I simultaneously felt pleased with the credibility of my deception but also trou- bled about the future consequences of this status
