## Focus Groups

- "This chapter defines focus groups as a research technique that collects data through group interaction on a topic determined by the researcher."

1. It's for data collection. Groups such as "therapy, decision making, education, organizing, or behavior change" aren't FG.
2. "focus groups should be distinguished from methods that collect data from **naturally occurring group discussions** where no one acts as an interviewer. The distinction here is not whether the group existed prior to the research, but whether the researcher’s interests directed the discussion"

- "According to the dimensions that define their typology, group interviews are something other than focus groups if they: (i) are conducted in informal settings; (ii) use nondirective interviewing; or (iii) use unstructured question formats."


## USES IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER METHODS



- "For example, **individual interview studies have used follow-up group interviews** to check the conclusions from their analyses and to expand the study populations included in the research."

- "In a complementary fashion, focus group studies have used follow-up **interviews with individual participants to explore specific opinions and experiences in more depth**, as well as to produce narratives that address the continuity of personal experiences over time"


- "With regard to ***sampling***, Morgan & Zhao (1993) and O’Connor et al (1992) both used surveys of medical records to divide a larger population into different “segments” that they then compared using separate sets of focus groups"

# STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF FOCUS GROUPS

- "the real strength of focus groups is not simply in exploring what people have to say, but in providing insights into the sources of complex behaviors and motivations"

- "the advantages of focus groups for investigating complex behaviors and motivations were a direct outcome of the interaction in focus groups, what has been termed “the group effect” [...] An emphasis on the specific kinds of interactions that occur in focus groups is also an improvement over vague assertions that “synergy” is one of their strengths."

- "What makes the discussion in focus groups more than the sum of separate individual interviews is the fact that the participants both query each other and explain themselves to each other."

- **moderator effects** (my term): "In particular, he noted that it is the moderator, rather than the ongoing work of the group, that determines the agenda and form of the discussion."


## Desventajas

1. Una persona puede dominar toda la discusion (mientras que ciertos participantes puedan tener miedo a declarar ciertos puntos de vistas por ser socialmente condenados).

2. Costo: hay que traer a todos los participantes, por un par de horas, en cierto lugar/tiempo especifico. 

3. No puedes llevar gente muy ocupada. Un ministro no va a ir a un focus group. Pero si podria eventualmente responder una entrevista.

## Ventajas

- "For example, in early HIV/AIDS research (Joseph et al 1984), epidemiologists used focus groups to gain a better understanding of **at-risk groups** with whom they had little prior experience, such as gay and bisexual men" **i.e. voice to the voiceless**.


### Standardization

- Estandarizar el set de temas.

* Ventaja: es comparable across focus groups.
* Desventaja: si sale mal al principio, tienes que aplicar el set de temas hasta que se haga el ultimo FG (para despues comparar).

Alternativa: hacer dos fases

* Fase 1: mas explatorio y libre; se aplica, cambia, y define gradualmente cual va a ser el set de preguntas del FG.
* Fase 2: mas fijo, y emplea el cuestionario que termino resultando mejor en la fase 1.


### Sampling

- “segmentation" (viene de la investigación de marketing): por demográficos, se reunen grupos de 6-8-10 personas con los mismos demográficos. **GRUPOS HOMOGENEOS.**

- "**Second, segmentation facilitates discussions** by making the participants more similar to each other." 

- la composicion de los grupos no tiene por que se homogeneo. **Depende de la pregunta.**

- "The obvious disadvantage of segmentation is that it can greatly multiply the number of groups"

### Number of Groups 

- "The most common rule of thumb is that most projects consist of **four to six focus groups**. The typical justification for this range is that the data become **“saturated”** and little new information emerges after the first few groups, so moderators can predict what participants will say even before they say it."

### Level of Moderator Involvement 

"The presence of a moderator is one of the most striking features of focus groups. Groups in which the moderator exercises a higher degree of control are termed “more structured"

### Group Size 

"The number of participants who are invited to a focus group is one element of the research design that is clearly under the researcher’s control. Morgan (1992a) reviewed the bases for determining group size, concluding that smaller groups were more appropriate with emotionally charged topics that generated high levels of participant involvement, while larger groups worked better with more neutral topics that generated lower levels of involvement. On the one hand, a smaller group gives each participant more time to discuss her or his views and experiences on topics in which they all are highly involved"
