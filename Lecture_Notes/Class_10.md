# Class 9: Interpretation

# Beginning 

1. Dar las dos criticas de KKV a los modelos interpretativistas (clase 8). Linkear con la mirada interpretativista de Geertz.
2. Explicar logica: primero hablar de la descripcion como ciencia, despues de la inferencia causal como ciencia. Foco: Explicar los polos. Despues, ir mas profundo en cada uno.

- "Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture"
- "From one point of view, that of the textbook, doing ethnography is establishing rapport, selecting informants, transcribing texts, taking ge? nealogies, mapping fields, keeping a diary, and so on. But it is not these things, techniques and received procedures, that define the enterprise. What defines it is the kind of intellectual effort it is: an elaborate ven? ture in, to borrow a notion from Gilbert Ryle, "thick description."


- "Consider, he says, two boys rapidly contracting the eyelids of their right eyes. In one, this is an involuntary twitch; in the other, a conspiratorial signal to a friend. The two movements are, as movements, identical ; from an l-am-a-camera, "phenomenalistic" observation of them alone, one could not tell which was twitch and which was wink, or indeed whether both or either was twitch or wink. Yet the difference, however unphotographable, between a twitch and a wink is vast; as anyone un? fortunate enough to have had the first taken for the second knows. The winker is communicating, and indeed communicating in a quite precise and special way: (I) deliberately, (2) to someone in particular, (3) to impart a particular message, (4) according to a socially established code, and (5) without cognizance of the rest of the company."

- But the point is that between what Ryle calls the "thin de? scription" of what the rehearser (parodist, winker, twitcher ... ) is doing ("rapidly contracting his right eyelids") and the "thick descrip? tion" of what he is doing ("practicing a burlesque of a friend faking a wink to deceive an innocent into thinking a conspiracy is in motion") lies the object of ethnography: a stratified hierarchy of meaningful structures in terms of which twitches, winks, fake-winks, parodies, re? hearsals of parodies are produced, perceived, and interpreted, and without which they would not (not even the zero-form twitches, which, as a cultural category, are as much nonwinks as winks are nontwitches) in fact exist, no matter what anyone did or didn't do with his eyelids.

- culture is not a power, something to which social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally attributed ; it is a context, something within which they can be intelligibly-that is, thickly-described

- If anthropological interpretation is constructing a reading of what happens, then to divorce it from what happens-from what, in this time or that place, specific people say, what they do, what is done to them, from the whole vast business of the world-is to divorce it from its ap? plications and render it vacant. A good interpretation of anything-a poem, a person, a history, a ritual, an institution, a society-takes us into the heart of that of which it is the interpretation

- The ethnographer "inscribes" social discourse ; he writes it down. In so doing, he turns it from a passing event, which exists only in its own moment of occurrence, into an account, which exists in its inscriptions and can be reconsulted. 

- Yet, the problem of how to get from a collection of ethnographic miniatures on the order of our sheep story-an assortment of remarks and anecdotes-to wall-sized culturescapes of the nation, the epoch, the continent, or the civilization is not so easily passed over with vague al? lusions to the virtues of concreteness and the down-to-earth mind. For a science born in Indian tribes, Pacific islands, and African lineages and subsequently seized with grander ambitions, this has come to be a major methodological problem, and for the most part a badly handled one. The models that anthropologists have themselves worked out to justify their moving from local truths to general visions have been, in fact, as responsible for undermining the effort as anything their critics? sociologists obsessed with sample sizes, psychologists with measures, or economists with aggregates-have been able to devise against them

- The important thing about the anthropologist's findings is their complex spe? cificness, their circumstantiality. It is with the kind of material produced by long-term, mainly (though not exclusively) qualitative, highly partici? pative, and almost obsessively fine-comb field study in confined contexts that the mega-concepts with which contemporary social science is affticted-legitimacy, modernization, integration, conflict, charisma, structure, . . . meaning-can be given the sort of sensible actuality that makes it possible to think not only realistically and concretely about them, but, what is more important, creatively and imaginatively with them.

- Although one starts any effort at thick description, beyond the obvious and superficial , from a state of general bewilderment as to what the devil is going on-trying to find one's feet-one does not start (or ought not) intellectually empty-handed. Theoretical ideas are not created wholly anew in each study; as I have said, they are adopted from other, related studies, and, refined in the process, applied to new interpretive problems

- "are the sciences of man are hermeneutical?"

- Interpretation, in the sense relevant to hermeneutics, is an attempt to make clear, to make sense of an object of study. This object must, therefore, be a text, or a text-analogue, which in some way is confused, incomplete, cloudy, seemingly contradic tory?in one way or another, unclear. The interpretation aims to bring to light an underlying coherence or sense
