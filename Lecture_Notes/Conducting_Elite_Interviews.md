## Contexto

- Beth Leech (mi profesora, yo fui ayudante) compiló una serie de ensayos respecto a métodos de entrevistas en un curso que se desarrolló en APSA (que es la conferencia más importante en CP) 2001.


## Leech 1: "Elite" Interviews

- The term elite interviewing generates some confusion and disagreement, as some researchers use “elite” to refer to the socioeconomic position of the respondent, whereas for others it has more to do with how the respondent is treated by the interviewer.

- In standardized interviewing, the investigator defines the question and the problem; he is only looking for answers within the bounds set by his presuppositions. In elite interviewing, as here defined, however, the investigator is willing, and often eager to let the interviewee teach him what the problem, the question, the situation, is.
  

  - The essays presented here for the most part focus on interviews of people in decision- making or leadership roles—members of Congress, members of parliaments, top-level bureaucrats, party leaders, and interest group leaders. More broadly speaking, however, elite interviewing can be used whenever it is ap- propriate to treat a respondent as an expert about the topic at hand. One of the essays on these pages, for example, involves interviews with activists, who while not “elites” in the socioeconomic sense of the word, are experts in their field and treated as such by the inter- viewer.

## Leech 2: Asking Questions: Techniques for Semistructured Interviews

- "Thanks to past jobs as a journalist and as an anthropological researcher, I’ve had train- ing in both journalistic and ethnographic styles of interviewing. The two are at the opposite ends of the interview continuum. The journalistic style tries to verbally pin the respondent down by appearing to know every- thing already. The questions are direct and directed toward a particular outcome. The ethnographic style of interviewing instead tries to enter into the world of the respondent by appearing to know very little."
- **Unstructured interviews**:
    - often used by ethnographers, are really more conversations than interviews, with even the topic of conversation subject to change as the interview progresses.
    - most appropriate when the interviewer has limited knowledge about a topic or wants an insider perspective
    - But the tendency for such interviews to wander off in unexpected directions—although they may provide for fresh ideas—almost guarantees that the interviews will not be a very consistent source of reliable data that can be compared across interviews [**remember de structured focused comparison**].
    - Unstructured interviews are best used as a source of insight, not for hypothesis testing.
- When the researcher already knows a lot about the subject matter [...] structured interviews with closed-ended questions are most appropriate.
- "Semistructured Interviews": "middle ground [where] one can provide detail, depth, and an insider’s perspective, while at the same time allowing hypothesis testing and the quantitative analysis of interview responses."

Rapport means more than just putting people at ease. It means convincing people that you are listening, that you understand and are interested in what they are talking about, and that they should continue talking.

### Putting Respondents at Ease

- The interviewer should seem professional and generally knowledgeable, but less knowledgeable than the respondent on the particular topic of the interview. **ella recomienda también no declarar que sabe mucho del tema, para que la gente le cuente más cosas**.

- many of your subjects will be more nervous than you are. After all, after you’ve done a couple of these, you are experienced. Your respondents, however, may never have been the subject of an academic study before. **Reassure them by being open and avoiding threatening descriptions of your work. “Talk with you” is less threatening than “interview you”**.

### Question Order

- but order is also important as a means of gaining rapport **mencionar ejemplo de averiguar sobre las jerarquías en las entrevistas, y la pregunta inicial**

- mi recomendación: siempre empezar con alguna comentario/pregunta que no tiene nada que ver.
- I find that it usually works better to ask things like age, background, title, and other personal things last.
- On the other hand, if your interview questions focus on an individual’s own political and philosophical beliefs, then obviously questions about education, background, and title would be less threatening and would provide a good place to start.
- "When and how should you ask sensitive questions? It’s usu- ally best to wait until the middle or toward the end of the in- terview. Don’t wait until the last minute—you may run out of time. Don’t hem, haw, or make it seem as though any normal person would refuse to answer this question. Just ask. Then be quiet, and give the respondent time to answer. Most people will try to fill the silence, and you will get your answer."
- "A second thing to remember about sensitive questions—or any question, for that matter—is to use nonjudgmental, non- threatening wording." **Ya, y usted tiene hijos, verdad?**

## Da a entender que haz estado escuchado: "hemos estado hablando de tema X. Me gustaria que me llevaras a la situacion donde tu hiciste Y, y cual fue tu impresion respecto a eso."


- promts (sondear) // lo que yo digo como **follow-up**
    - probe about coalition partners (formal or informal)
    - probe about who they are speaking with about this issue. 
    - promts: These may be nothing more than raising an eyebrow and cocking one’s head, or they may be specific questions: “How?” “Why?” and “And then…?” 



# Goldstein

- Unfortunately, none of these skills matter if you do not get the interview.
- Furthermore and funda- mentally, systematic error will also be introduced if researchers only get access to certain types of respondents.
- In the survey research world, we talk about random error and nonrandom error (sys- tematic error.) **dibujar error con tiro al blanco**

1. enviar una carta/email solicitando la participacion en un estudio.
2. poner numero de telefono/direccion/nombre del investigador responsable (dar cara visible a quien es responsable).
3. decir si la entrevista va a ser grabada/fotografiada o no.
4. que criterios de confidencialidad hay? (**esta entrevista forma parte de cien otras entrevistas** da la sensacion de anonimato).
5. cuidado desde donde mandan el email (no email privado, y menos si es inapropiado).

# Aberbach

- entrevistas con preguntas cerradas: muy en la logica de una encuesta.
- open-ended: son mas ricas, pero son dificiles de codificar.
- coding: 
    - Manifest coding items involved direct responses to particular questions (for example, whether differences between the parties are great, moderate or few). 
    - Latent coding items were those where the characteristics of the response coded were not explicitly called for by the questions themselves (for example, we coded variables dealing with positive and negative references towards the role of conflict from questions about the nature of conflict in American society and the de- gree to which it can be reconciled).
- hablar de ***intercoder reliability***.


# Preguntas

- para los que hayan hecho ya las entrevistas, cómo ha sido la experiencia?
- grabarían una entrevista sin decirle que la están grabando?
- que ventajas desdventajas tiene hacer estructuradas vs. no estructuradas? [acumulacion/comparacion].

# Mi experiencia

- las entrevistas pasan en lugares diversos: no siempre es on/off (hay que saber cuando la entrevista ha empezado).
- cada entrevista es diferente.
- 
- lenguaje corporal.
- entrevistar personas que no estaban presupuestadas (o no figuraban en el organigrama de la organizacion)
- preguntar "personas B" (secretarias, ayudantes, auxiliares): ellos tienen a saber mucho mas que los directivos de los servicios en ciertos temas. **En vez del politico, entreviste al jefe de campana.**
- 
- ser flexible
